title: "Discriminating cancer drivers from passengers"
summary: "Each cancer genome is characterized by tens-to-thousands of DNA mutations, but only a minority of those mutations is expected to drive tumor development and progression. The vast majority of mutations are so called passenger mutations that are carried along in the genomes of proliferating tumor cells. Discriminating drivers from passengers remains an important challenge in cancer 'omics research. We are developing new strategies to improve identification of drivers by studying mutations in the context of protein interaction networks."
