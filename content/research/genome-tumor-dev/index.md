title: "Uncovering interactions between the inherited genome and tumor development"
summary: "Cancer develops on an individual's unique genetic background. While some inherited mutations are known to predispose individuals to developing tumors, little is known about the effects of such inherited genetic variation on the evolution of the tumor genome. We are working to uncover new regions of the genome that influence the probability that certain mutations will occur during tumor development. We previously described multiple loci that influence mutation rates of known cancer genes and the site at which a tumor will occur."
